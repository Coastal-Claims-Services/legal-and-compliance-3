## Integration Steps for Talha

### Step 1: Copy Files to Employee Portal

Copy these files from `compliance-and-legal-hub` to `coastalclaims-employee-portal`:

**Frontend:**
```
src/pages/ComplianceLegalHub.tsx ‚Üí src/pages/ComplianceLegalHub.tsx
```

**Backend (if not already present):**
```
server/src/models/ComplianceRule.ts
server/src/models/ComplianceTemplate.ts
server/src/models/ComplianceAlert.ts
server/src/models/ComplianceState.ts
server/src/models/ComplianceChatHistory.ts
server/src/routes/compliance.ts
```

### Step 2: Update Employee Portal Navigation

In `src/components/Layout.tsx`, add this menu item in the admin section:

```typescript
{ path: '/admin/compliance-legal-hub', name: 'Compliance & Legal Hub', icon: <Gavel size={20} /> }
```

### Step 3: Update Employee Portal Routing

In `src/components/AdminRouter.tsx`, add this route:

```typescript
<Route path="/admin/compliance-legal-hub" element={<ComplianceLegalHub />} />
```

Don't forget the import:
```typescript
import ComplianceLegalHub from '@/pages/ComplianceLegalHub';
```

### Step 4: Register Backend Routes (if needed)

In `server/src/index.ts`, ensure these routes are registered:

```typescript
import complianceRoutes from './routes/compliance';
app.use('/api/compliance', complianceRoutes);
```

### Step 5: Database Setup

The system uses MongoDB. If using the existing employee portal database:
- Models will auto-create collections on first use
- Database name: `coastal-claims-portal` (or whatever is in your .env)

If you want a separate database:
- Update MONGO_URI in server/.env to point to `legal-compliance-3` database
