    Alabama **does not license or recognize public adjusters.**  
    The Department of Insurance FAQ states that anyone acting for a policy‑
    holder on a claim must do so as an attorney or be in danger of unlicensed
    activity penalties and the unauthorized practice of law.  No bond, fee cap,
    or contract form is available because the role itself is not recognized.
